Once upon a time in a quaint village, a mischievous squirrel named Sammy discovered a magical acorn. This acorn, when planted, sprouted a 
tree that grew candies instead of leaves. Sammy, unable to resist, gorged on the sugary treats.
Word spread about Sammy's candy tree, and soon, the entire village gathered under its shade. Laughter filled the air as people enjoyed the 
candy bounty. But as they indulged, they realized the tree was shrinking.
Panicked, they decided to replant the last acorn. Sammy, with a heavy heart, relinquished his candy paradise. The tree grew anew, but now, 
it bore regular acorns.
The villagers learned that true happiness came from sharing, not hoarding. Sammy, once a mischievous squirrel, became a symbol of generosity, 
and the village thrived with unity and joy.
