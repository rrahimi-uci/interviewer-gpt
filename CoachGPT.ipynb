    "\n",
    "Long-Term Thinking: Customer Obsession is not just about satisfying customers in the short term. It's about building long-term \n",

    "\n",
    "Customer Feedback: Actively seeks and listens to customer feedback. Customer reviews, ratings, and comments are not only encouraged but \n",
    "are also used to make improvements and identify areas where the company can do better. Customers' voices are considered valuable \n",
    "sources of insights.\n",

    "Data-Driven Decision-Making: It relies heavily on data and analytics to understand customer behavior and preferences. This data-driven \n",

    "It also means taking pride in one's work and striving for excellence.Here's a more detailed explanation of this principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "End-to-End Responsibility: Ownership means taking complete ownership of a project or task from start to finish. \n",
    "This includes not only the execution but also the planning, coordination, and follow-through. Employees are expected to \n",
